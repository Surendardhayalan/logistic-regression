Logistic regression:

Binary Classification refers to predicting the output variable that is discrete in two classes.

A few examples of Binary classification are Yes/No, Pass/Fail, Win/Lose, Cancerous/Non-cancerous, etc.

Multinomial Logistic Regression: The output variable is discrete in three or more classes with no natural ordering.

Food texture: Crunchy, Mushy, Crispy

Hair colour: Blonde, Brown, Brunette, Red​

Ordered Logistic Regression: Aka Ordinal regression model. The output variable is discrete in three or more classes with the ordering of the levels.

Customer Rating: extremely dislike, dislike, neutral, like, extremely like

Income level: low income, middle income, high income

Advantages of logistic regression
Logistic regression is much easier to implement than other methods, especially in the context of machine learning.
Logistic regression works well for cases where the dataset is linearly separable.

Sigmoid Function:
The sigmoid function is useful to map any predicted values of probabilities into another value between 0 and 1.

Sigmoid function: σ(z) = 1/(1+e−z)





Case 1: the predicted value for x1 is ≈0.2 which is less than the threshold, so x1 belongs to class 0.

Case 2: the predicted value for the point x2 is ≈0.6 which is greater than the threshold, so x2 belongs to class 1.

So far so good, yeah!
